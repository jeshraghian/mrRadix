# mrRadix
Convert pre-trained weights of pre-defined precision to weights in the X-numeral system.

## Getting Started
Two alternative versions of the code are provided.
One performs only the weight conversion.
The other performs the weight conversion as well as the ReLU activation in the X-numeral system.

## Deployment
All variables are pre-defined within the code and should be modified by the user directly.
